<p>Jun. 2022-present,Supervised by Prof. Yan Zhang (Central South University)</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducted interviews with and tracked recovery trajectories of depressive and anxious adolescents, designed the research question to evaluate the role of rumination in the development of mood disorders based on clinical observations.</li>
<li>Writing a review paper to summarize existing clinical and neural evidence related to the mechanism of rumination, providing assumptions about the potential neural pathway underlying compulsive rumination (which involves the ventral stratum/nucleus accumbens impairment) and discussing the implications of treatments.</li>

<h3 id="the-role-of-autobiographical-memory-in-psychopathology---------melbourne-australia">The Role of Autobiographical Memory in Psychopathology,					         Melbourne, Australia</h3>
<p>Nov. 2021-Aug. 2022, Supervised by Dr Caitlin Hitchcock (University of Cambridge)</p>
<ul>
<li>Used JavaScript to design and construct psychological experiment websites to collect reaction times, button and text responses related to memory recall of participants.</li>
<li>Conducted individual patient data meta-analysis (N = 8440) to investigate the influences of overgeneral autobiographical memories on psychopathological symptoms. Prepared R code to do multivariate multilevel analysis.</li>

<h3 id="the-associations-between-rumination-worry-depression-and-anxiety-honours-thesis----------melbourne-australia">The Associations Between Rumination, Worry, Depression and Anxiety	 (Honours Thesis), 	         Melbourne, Australia</h3>
<p>Nov. 2020-present, Supervised by Dr Nicholas Van Dam (University of Melbourne)</p>
<ul>
<li>Analysing data using Structural Equation Modelling in R to explore relationships among measures of depression, anxiety and repetitive negative thoughs. Independently completed assumptions (e.g., normality, correlation among variables) checking and tested various model structures (e.g., tri-model, hierarchical model, transdiagnostic model) to explore the best-fitting structural model (i.e., a hierarchical model where depression and anxiety exist as independent constructs but share a common factor Negative Affect).</li>
<li>Found rumination and worry to be equally associated with depression and anxiety using a newly developed measure of repetitive negative thoughts, wrote a first-authored paper which is currently in preparation for publication.</li>

<p>Mar.2020-Aug.2020, Supervised by Dr Vanja Rozenblat (University of Melbourne)</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducted literature search, collaborating with group members to collect data and analysing the data  using moderation analysis in R. Found a significant positive association between social media pressure and thin-ideal internalisation, although self- compassion was not a significant moderator.</li>
